 ## Definition & Concepts:
   - Edge computing is about reducing the latency in cloud computing. Instead of sending data back to the cloud server,We can  process the data by nearby location.
   
   > Distributed computing paradigm that brings computation and data storage closer to the location where it is needed, to improve response time.

- Deals with **Instant Data** rather than *Big Data*
- Usually **Instant Data** deals with real time data generated by the users or by sensors.

  Since it deals with **Sensors** and **Real time data**,we can make use of **IoT devices**.

 ## Advantages
  
- Instead of performing computation in the data centers we can go for computation at the edge devices (i.e mobiles,network gateways). These edge devices acts as on behalf of what cloud will do.
-  Because of moving to edge devices, we can have many advantages.
      - Better response and transfer rate
      - better caching (i.e faster access)
      - storage
   
## Challenges

But at the same time, it has some challenging tasks too. For example : Managing different edge devices.
  - In terms of Privacy and security, since it is moving distributed needs a **Special encryption mechanism**
  - Scalability - challenging one due to availability to different edge devices.
  - Reliability - if one node fails, we must ensure some measures in order to maintain it to be fault tolerant. 
  - Speed - faster response than cloud computing
  - Efficiency - Bandwidth saving


## Applications in Machine learning 
 Merging of Machine Learning and Edge Computing is called EdgeML. This is one of the main usecase of using Edge Computing. There are many application that use this field already like Smart Watches , self driving cars etc.
    It's more like integration of IoT(as Edge Computing ) , Machine Learning
 
 - HealthCare 
       1.  [Wearable healthcare](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11628-020-00428-3) devices can keep eye on chronic conditions for patients.
       2.   [Robots assisting](https://www.uclahealth.org/robotic-surgery/what-is-robotic-surgery) in surgery

- Space & Astronomy
       1.   [Speeding up Space Exploration](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/microsoft-hpe-partner-to-deliver-ai-edge-computing-on-iss/article33843494.ece) to reduce latency time for International Space Station to transmit data to NASA.
 - Self-driving car
         1. [Autonomous car](https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-learning-for-self-driving-cars-7f198ef4cfa2) - sensing its environment and moving safely with little or no human input.
         2.  For example: Tesla Self driving cars
- Video Conferencing & Streaming
          1. 	To reduce latency while during Live will be very suitable use case for the Edge Computing.
          2. 	For example : Twitch
  
- Content Delivery Network
         1.  CDN for the easy access of the resources with the help of nearby server.
                For example : bootstrap cdn, react cdn , threejs cdn
